threat_note is a great little app that allows security researchers, incident responders and other security practitioners a place to collect indicators of compromise. threat_note has been designed to integrate with a variety of 3rd party services. Integration with these services allows the user to pull data in which allows questions about an indicator to be easily answered. One useful integration is with [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://www.cuckoosandbox.org). Cuckoo is malware analysis sandbox used to detonate suspicious executables. Cuckoo collects data around the  files execution including network traffic and file hashes.  Enabling Cuckoo integration in threat_note is simple and quickly allow the investigator to grab IOCs from previously analyzed sample.
